# Greetings and good health

So, here we are... you are reading my Github profile in my future, and here I am writing it in your past.

Did you ever stop and consider the stars for a moment? How the light we see in the night's darkness is millions of years old? We weren't even born when that light began it's journey over the vast distances of what we know as space. When we look at the night sky we are looking into the past. The stars we see might already be dead and we wouldn't know about it until millions of years later when their light finally reached us. By then our own existence, of course, would have dwindled a long time ago.

It's similiar when you look at old photos, videos, works of art, and old buildings - light and matter captured, in a sense, of things long past. Echoes from what once was.

When you have a conscious thought, your subconsciousness thought of it first, you only become aware of it once it has already happened. We are living in memories.

What is the present then, what is in the now? We can never know. It is hidden from our eyes, it is hidden from our minds and thoughts. Time is a slow moving liquid, time is space, time is distance, and time is motion.

We see the ripples of our actions manifest themselves in our tomorrow. Was it always there? Does it change constantly with each moment defying prediction through the sheer number of possibilities and moving parts? Who can tell. Yet here we are. Or we think that we are. With the vast distances of mine space and time separating us.

I am you speaking to yourself. Assault of waves upon the beach. Actions and reactions from long ago. Before you knew it I was here all the time - not as a god, but as a man, simple, like yourself. A part of your fate.

There are no words beyond this point.
