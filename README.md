# Greetings and good health

So, here we are... you are reading my Github profile in my future, and here I am writing it in your past.

Did you ever stop and consider the stars for a moment? How the light we see in the night's darkness is millions of years old? We weren't even born when that light began it's journey over the vast distances of what we know as space. When we look at the night sky we are looking into the past. The stars we see might already be dead and we wouldn't know about it until millions of years later when their light finally reaches us. By then our own existence, of course, would have dwindled away a long time ago.

It's similiar when you look at old photos, videos, works of art, and old buildings - light and matter captured, in a sense, of things and actions long past. Echoes from what once was.

When you have a conscious thought, your subconsciousness thought of it first, you only became aware of it once it had already happened. We are living in memories.

What is the present then, what is in the now? We can never know. It is hidden from our eyes, it is hidden from our minds and thoughts. Time is a slow moving liquid, time is space, time is distance, and time is motion. Or maybe it's just a property of perception.

We see the ripples of our actions manifest themselves in our tomorrow. Were they always there? Does the future change, constantly, with each moment defying understanding through the sheer number of possibilities? Who can say. Yet here we are, thinking that we are - with the vast distances of mind, space and time separating us.

I am you speaking to yourself. You are reading this in your internal voice.

I am an assault of waves upon the beach of your mind. Actions and reactions from a long ago - in the now. Your own thoughts you never knew existed. But at the same time I was here with you all the time - not as a god, but as a man - simple, like yourself.

There are no words beyond this point, only madness. Silence is our only option.
