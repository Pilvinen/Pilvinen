# Greetings and good health

So, here we are... you are reading my Github profile in my future, and here I am writing it in your past.

To be able to understand each other we need to have a compatible medium for communication and similar experiences of the things we are trying to describe.

We can describe the unions, separations, transformations, and divisions of concepts and things. And we can name them. We can understand their relations, associations, and behaviors in respect to one another.

However, we cannot describe or understand fundamental existence. Everything that can be said or described is just rhetoric. From one came the many through countless of divisions. Nothing that holds true can be said about the one. Everything can be said about the many, but only in relation to one another.

All such wonders that exist to our minds - yet nothing exists and nothing can be described. This is the pain of the division of the world.

There are no words beyond this point. Silence is our only option.
