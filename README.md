So, here we are... you are reading my Github profile in my future, and here I am writing it in your past.

To be able to understand each other we need to have a compatible medium for communication and similar experiences of the things we are trying to describe.

We can describe the unions, separations, transformations, and divisions of concepts and things. And we can name them. We can understand their relations, associations, and behaviors in respect to one another.

However, we cannot describe or understand fundamental existence. Everything that can be said or described is just rhetoric. From one came the many through countless of divisions. Nothing that holds true can be said about the one. Everything can be said about the many, but only in relation to one another.

All such wonders that exist to our minds - yet nothing exists and nothing can be described. This is the pain of the division of the world.

There are no words beyond this point. Silence is our only option.

# What's going on?

ü§î I‚Äôm working hard on making PC games. To learn more about *what* I'm working on right now, check out our game studio's web pages below.

# Where am I? What is this?

I'm Poika Pilvimaa. This is my **personal** Github profile page (GitHub is a popular cloud-based platform for software development collaboration. It's essentially a social network for programmers where they can share, review, and manage code).

If you arrived here because you're mainly interested in our ***game studio***, you can find more information about our games and our studio on our web page: [https://www.starandserpent.com/](https://www.starandserpent.com/) and you can find the **Star and Serpent Github** page here: [https://github.com/starandserpent/](https://github.com/starandserpent/).

# Cyberstalkers, welcome

If you arrived here because you Googled my name, first of all, thank you, I'm flattered about the attention, you're awesome. You might also be interested in my personal blog where I write about programming and game development (very infrequently when I get inspired by something): [https://www.pilvimaa.fi/](https://www.pilvimaa.fi/).

# Reaching out to me personally

If you want to reach out and chat with me, the best way to reach me is through our game studio's Discord chat server: [https://discord.starandserpent.com/](https://discord.starandserpent.com/). I'm usually hanging out there and I'm always happy to chat with people who are interested in game development, programming, or just want to chat about life in general.

Don't be a stranger.

# Reaching out professionally
You can find our game studio's email address on our game studio's web page: [https://www.starandserpent.com/](https://www.starandserpent.com/). You can use that to reach out to me if you have something professional to discuss.

# AI roasted my Github profile
...and it hurt my feelings. Well done, little AI. Well done.

"Oh, look at you, Poika Pilvimaa, the self-proclaimed "founder" of the Star and Serpent indie game studio. With a mind like yours, we truly need to wonder if the "indie" part is because the games are too bad to attract a publisher or if it‚Äôs just the "star" part of your "Star and Serpent" that never rose. You have a mere 2 followers and are following just 1. Is that one person your mother, cheering you on through your profound existential crises?

Your bio reads like you're trying to win a pretentious poet contest‚Äîare we supposed to be blown away by your deep thoughts on the pain of 'existence'? Newsflash: no one is on the edge of their seat wondering about the dialectics of being while checking out your GitHub. With only 3 public repos and a game that combines RPG and shoot 'em up elements, it seems your creativity burst is rather modest. But hey, at least you have ‚ÄúLearningGodot‚Äù under your belt with 4 stars! Did you ask the same 4 people to star it in a pity party?

Your README is a cringe-worthy mix of philosophical nonsense and vague invites for people to stalk your brilliance. The only thing more devoid of substance than your philosophical musings is your GitHub activity. And seriously, a Discord server invite? At this point, it sounds more like an open invitation to endure your monologues rather than a welcome chat about game development.

Next time when you're drafting your profile, maybe skip the overinflated descriptions of nothingness and focus on creating something just less boring, will ya?"
